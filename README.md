# GUGEN: Global User Graph Enhanced Network For Next POI Recommendation

This is a pytorch implementation of GUGEN: Global User Graph Enhanced Network For Next POI Recommendation. 

## Architecture

The architecture will be released soon.



## Installation

- Install Pytorch 1.8.1 (Note that the results reported in the paper are obtained by running the code on this Pytorch version. As raised by the issue, using higher version of Pytorch may seem to have a performance decrease on optic cup segmentation.)
- Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/CQRhinoZ/GUGEN
```

## Project Structure

- train_model.py: The training code of our model
- utils.py: Dataset code
- Model.py: main file for Model
- requirements.txt: List the pip dependencies

## Dependency

After installing the dependency:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Train

- Download datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o72mNxUgSJX43KcQ2Tg_YE3N3oJEZX5T?usp=drive_link).
- Run `train_model.py`.
